## About

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Research Bay is a community-driven project built by students at the Developer Student Club at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) that aims to provide a streamlined and standardized platform for UIUC professors and students to easily connect with research opportunities and talent.

### Background

TODO

### Solution

TODO

### Structure

Research Bay is built as a scalable web application that uses the principles of REST and Serverless to be efficient, modular, and open to future expansion. It is separated into two main components: a React.js frontend app and a Serverless backend API powered by multiple Firebase/GCP services, such as Cloud Functions, Storage, and Firestore. A mobile app in Flutter for Android is currently in the planning stage and would easily integrate with the existing backend.

For organized development, Research Bay's code is divided into the following three public Github repositories:

* [Frontend](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-frontend)
* [Backend](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-backend)
* [Data/ML](https://github.com/DSC-UIUC/rbay-data-ml)

More detailed documentation specific to each component can be found in each repository's README file.
